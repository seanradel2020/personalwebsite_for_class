 <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>Currently, I am serving as a Cloud Security Engineering Intern at CyberArk, where I am actively involved in developing scalable infrastructure using tools like Pulumi, Grafana, and AWS services. I use TypeScript and Python for scripting while also  managing CI/CD processes through Jenkins, and GitHub. My primary focus is on implementing security in the cloud with an agile DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering team.</p>
 <p>In addition to my current role, I have gained valuable experience as a Systems Engineering Intern at General Dynamics Electric Boat and as a Cybersecurity Intern at the Federal Govenrment. My involvement extends to the research front, where I have made contributions to the Privacy Engineering Regulatory Compliance Lab, worked in the VEMI Lab, and held the role of President of the University of Maine Cybersecurity Team.</p>
 <p>I am deeply passionate about data privacy compliance and regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. This diverse skill set and my commitment make me a versatile and capable candidate for roles in cloud engineering, cybersecurity, or site relability engineering.</p>
 <p>I am a senior computer science student at the University of Maine. When I graduate in May 2024, I want to continue working with cloud technologies and writing infrastructure as code.</p>
 <p>When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy getting out by the water. I love to surf, sail, fish, and take walks at the beach. I also enjoy wine tasting and trying craft beer. I make my own dark chocolate and I love making pasta from scratch. </p>
