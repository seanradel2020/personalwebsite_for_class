Hey Dr. G, 

Website Link: http://seanradel.infinityfreeapp.com/PortfolioWebsite/index.html

I hope you like my website!

I built this website off of the citrus website we built in class. Due to time constraints I was not able to clean up all of the unused images / resources. 
I used ChatGPT to generate a summary of my resume on my about me page. All other work is mine. 

My final pages came out slightly differnet than the wireframes I originally designed, but I am happy with the outcome.
I purposefully left off any footers on this webpage.
